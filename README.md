<h1>3dPrintedLino</h1>
Replicating lino print making through the use of a 3d printer and free software.

Pick an image that you would like to print and save it to your computer.
<img width="25%" height="25%" src="https://github.com/hcarter45/3dPrintedLino/blob/master/lino.jpg?raw=true"></img>

Open up the image with paint 3d. It comes free and preinstalled with windows 10. (Photoshop has tools to select specific colors that would make this process even easier, if you have access to that paid software.

Choose the magic select tool. I recommend that you do not crop out the borders as it is helpful to have a common base for the various prints. (This will make more sense later)

Pick a color you want to isolate first. Using the magic select tool add all of the chosen color and the border, but remove every other color. The tool gets smarter and becomes better at selecting the desired colors overtime, but expect to spend several minutes. Click done to end the magic select tool. Drag the selected image away from the unselected image using the drag tool that appears. Cut the image you selected, that isolated only one color and then click menu -> new to create a new portrait. Do not save the inital image that you downloaded because you are going to need to isolate various other layers and you want the base image to do so. 

With the isolated image, crop out the background white if it appears.

Save this image as an svg file.
